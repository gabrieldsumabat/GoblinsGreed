# GoblinsGreed
Single player RPG game. Development is ongoing.

Disowned and disinherited by the Baron, you are left penniless and vengeful. 
At the GUILD you have signed a blood pact in exchange for the gold you need to seek revenge.
Complete quests and hunt epic monsters for their loot, but beware! 
Your greedy teammates might betray you as you get closer and closer to the shiny gold!
Should you fail to earn enough gold to keep up with your growing debt, the GUILD will stake their claim on your heart.
Treasures and Trials await!
